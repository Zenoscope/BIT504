// Still to compete:
Find the titlebar size from the other one.
Change the ball fall out the bottom to the window size
Collisions using internal ball speed rather than settings file

		add(statusBar, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
		// account for statusBar height in overall height
		setPreferredSize(new Dimension(CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT + 30));

// extra:
Change it to use a rectangular field instead of the whole window

Describe the methods you used to test your program including:
o How you tested the functionality and usability of your program. Be clear
about what tests you used, the results of those tests, and how those results
were addressed.

 Tests used: 
Whitebox testing
 Running code and using the debugger to step through and debugging the code.
 Using text to print out messages to confirm functionality: 
   Location of the paddle and ball, spawn points for the bricks, messages when the ball collides with bricks or the paddle, and when the game finishes.
 
Blackbox testing:
 Running the program and checking functionality:
  Confirm the paddle moves in the correct when the assigned keys are presssed.
  Confirm the blocks are drawn and destroyed when the ball hits them.
  Confirm the ball bounces off the paddle.
  Confirm the ball changes direction when hitting the window borders.
  Confirm the ball respawns and goes in the correct direction.
  Confirm the game ends with XXXXX when the ball hits the bottom of the window
  Confirm the game ends with XXXXX when all of the blocks are destroyed.
  
o Examples of how the program could be tested for compliance
Compliance with what? (code compliance and best practice?)

â€¢ Discuss any strategies implemented to improve the maintainability of the program.
Include the strategies implemented and how they work to improve maintainability.
Maintainability:
Global setting in the settings file - to set initial ball/paddle speed
Setting the ball and paddle speed so that they can be changed later (eg ball speeds up/slows down)
Using the window side rather than hard coding
Coding practices - separeat files for objects. Sprite as parent, ball and paddle as children.
Main loop is a separate file along
